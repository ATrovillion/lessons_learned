>What type of variable name casing do you use in JavaScript? (think of snakes or camels)
* JavaScript uses camel case (camelCase?), as opposed to lionCase, tigerCase, or bearCase (oh my!).

>If you want to create a variable called mentor and set its value equal to the name of your mentor, how would you do that?
* I would declare the variable as follows: `var mentor = 'Carrie Coxwell'`

>How would you then log the value of mentor to the console?
I would use the following: `console.log(mentor)`

>Describe the difference between let, var, and const.
* `let` is a new type of variable declaration (in ES6) that allows us to scope a variable to a particular block (set of curly brackets).
* `var` is the way a new variable is instantiated (created).
* `const`, also new in ES6, allows us to create a constant, which is a variable whose value cannot be reassigned.
