>In our “Say Hi” example, if the Say Hi part of the program never runs, how would you narrow down the problem?
* I would move backward from the desired effect (the "Hello, !" output) to find the last step of the process that actually worked. I would then work forward from that point to find the error.

>What would the roadmap for narrowing down the Say Hi problem look like?
* Prompting for output
* Taking input from user
* Storing user input
* Packaging user input into correct spot in "Hello, !" string
* Outputting the `Hello, <username>!` phrase.

>Create a problem-solving example using a roadmap and the process of elimination for narrowing down issues of your own. You already use this skill daily. 
> Break down and explain a problem you solve in your everyday life.
* Watching television:
* Roadmap:
  * Find both remote controls (sound and television)
  * Turn on television with television remote
  * Turn on sound with sound remote
  * Wait for television to connect to internet
  * Navigate to desired programming
  * Press play
  * Enjoy television
* Problem solving:
  * If there is some aspect of the television-watching experience that doesn't work, I work backward to each of the elements of the roadmap to determine where something has gone wrong.
    * Programming won't play?--check wifi signal, router, internet service
    * Television won't connect to internet--make sure wifi password is correctly saved in television memory
    * Pictures move but no sound--check that soundbar is on/connected to television
    * Television won't turn on--check that television is plugged in
    * Can't find both remote controls--Scold children for not putting tiny remote controls in a place where the next user can find them.
